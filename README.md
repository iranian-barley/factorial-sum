# factorial-sum
Python algorithm for a mathematical iteration problem related to Strong Numbers.

The problem is similar to Paul Yiu's "Iterations of sum of powers of digits" problem:

Here the sum of the factorials of the individual digits of a number is iterated until a cycle arrives. It is provable that 7 cycles exist.
